Hey Julia!

When creating your MCreator workspace, I accidentally made it a Neoforage instead of a Forge model. This has no impact on your mods in your game but will change how to access it in Curseforge.

In order to ensure you can properly access your mod with Curseforge, when following the instructions and you are creating a new profile, make sure the gamemode is set to Neoforge instead of forge.


If you come across any complications, don't be afraid to reach out.
